ConnectFour
===========
by Saajid Moyen

This is the game ConnectFour written in Haskell. It is played from the terminal by typing commands. Currently the working version is in ConnectFour.hs and is a two player game. MinimaxCF.hs contains an in-progress version of ConnectFour with an AI that selects moves using the "negamax" version of the minimax algorithm. 


INSTRUCTIONS:

To play the game, type "runhaskell ConnectFour.hs" or load the file into the Haskell interpreter and type "main"
The game will prompt each user for his or her move. Valid inputs are integers between 1 and 7 inclusive, which correspond to the number of the column from left to right.
To play again, use the same command as before to run the file again.
